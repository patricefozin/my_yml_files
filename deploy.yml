# This playbook is meant to grab an image from github and run a container from that image. It would first stop any container that 
# has the same name as the one we are attempting to create. It would also remove that container, then remove any image with the name
# similar to the image we will be pulling. Once all that cleanup done, it will pull a fresh image and run a fresh container 
# from it.
